# mta-ingameScriptsEditor

## TODO
- [x] saving files
- [x] changing themes of editor
- [x] closing things on ESC key instead going to MTA main menu
- [ ] create functions for that colored buttons (minimalize, close, fullscreen)
- [ ] maybe online version (browser), so you could edit server's scripts even on the phone, when you are not home?
